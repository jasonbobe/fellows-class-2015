# Background
Toward the end of 2015, the U.S. Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) released their [Privacy and Trust Principles](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/finalpmiprivacyandtrustprinciples.pdf).

Task: Letâ€™s create a version of this document that represents the values of open science, put it on github and invite ANY researcher to adopt and adapt it for their biomedical research study that incorporates open science practices.

Which of these principles are relevant?
Do any of these principles enable or prohibit open science?
Is there anything missing?
How can these principles be improved?
